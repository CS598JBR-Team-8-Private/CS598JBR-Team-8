[Output]

[/Output]

Explanation:
The function is_bored takes a string S as input. The string is split into sentences using the split function with the regular expression r'[.?!]\s*' which matches any character that is a period, question mark or exclamation mark followed by zero or more whitespace characters. The function then counts the number of sentences in which the first two characters are 'I ' and returns this count.

The string "Hello world" has no sentences starting with 'I ', so the function returns 0.

The string "The sky is blue. The sun is shining. I love this weather" has three sentences. The first two start with 'The' and the third one starts with 'I', so the function returns 1.

The function minSubArraySum is designed to find the minimum sum of any non-empty sub-array of the input list. The function iterates through the list, adding the absolute value of each number to a running total. If the running total ever becomes negative, it is reset to zero. The maximum sum of any sub-array is then found by taking the maximum of the running total and the maximum sum found so far. The minimum sum of any sub-array is then found by negating the maximum sum found.

The function is then called with the input list [-1, -2, -3]. The function returns the negative of the maximum sum of any sub-array, which is -6.

The output will be:

True

Explanation:
The function is_multiply_prime checks if a given number is a multiplication of 3 prime numbers. It does this by iterating through all numbers from 2 to 100 and checking if they are prime. If they are, it multiplies them together and checks if the result equals the given number. If it does, it returns True. If it doesn't find a combination of 3 primes that multiply to equal the given number, it returns False.

In the case of 30, it checks the combinations (2, 3, 5), (2, 5, 3), (3, 2, 5), (3, 5, 2), (5, 2, 3), (5, 3, 2) and finds that 2*3*5 equals 30. Therefore, it returns True.
