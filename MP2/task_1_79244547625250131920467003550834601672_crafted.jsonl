It first defines a helper function `digits_sum` which calculates the sum of the digits of a number. If the number is negative, it multiplies the number by -1 and sets a variable `neg` to -1. It then converts the absolute value of the number to a string, splits this string into a list of characters, converts each character back to an integer, and sums these integers. The result is returned.\n\nThe `order_by_points` function then sorts the input list `nums` based on the sum of the digits of each number. The `key` argument of the `sorted` function is set to `digits_sum`, which means that the sorting is done based on the return value of `digits_sum` for each element in `nums`.\n\nIn the given example, the list `[1, 11, -1, -11, -12]` is sorted based on the sum of the digits of each number. The sums of the digits are 1 (for 1), 2 (for 11), 1 (for -1), 2 (for -11), and 3 (for -12). Since the sums are different, the list is not sorted. The function returns the list `[1, -1, -11, 11, -12]`.\n\nFor an empty list, the function returns an empty list.\n", "is_correct": false}
