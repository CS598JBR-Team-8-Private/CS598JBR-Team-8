The `findZero` method finds a root of a polynomial with coefficients in a list. It uses the bisection method to find the root.\n\nThe Java code is wrapped in a class named `Solution`. The `poly` method takes a `List<Double>` and a `double` as arguments and returns a `double`. The `findZero` method also takes a `List<Double>` and returns a `double`.\n\nThe bisection method is used to find the root of the polynomial. The method starts by guessing a range where the root is. It then iteratively refines the range until the root is found. The range is refined", "is_correct": 1}
