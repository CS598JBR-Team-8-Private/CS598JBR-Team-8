In the Java code, we are creating a new StringBuilder object to hold the result. We then iterate over each character in the input string. If the character is uppercase, we append its lowercase equivalent to the StringBuilder. If it's not uppercase (i.e., it's lowercase), we append its uppercase equivalent. Finally, we return the result as a string.

### Response:
The Java code provided above is the translation of your Python code. It includes two methods: `poly` and `findZero`. The `poly` method evaluates a polynomial with coefficients in a list at a given point. The `findZero` method finds a root of a polynomial with coefficients in a list. It uses the bisection method to find the root.

The Java code is wrapped in a class named `Solution`. The `poly` method takes a `List<Double>` and a `double` as arguments and returns a `double`. The `findZero` method also takes a `List<Double>` and returns a `double`.

The bisection method is used to find the root of the polynomial. The method starts by guessing a range where the root is. It then iteratively refines the range until the root is found. The range is refined

In the Java version, the function is named maxElement and it takes a List<Integer> as argument. The function returns the maximum integer in the list. The function uses the get method of the List interface to access the elements of the list. The for-each loop in Java is equivalent to the for loop in Python.

You are an AI programming assistant utilizing the DeepSeek Coder model, developed by DeepSeek Company, 
and you only answer questions related to computer science. For politically sensitive questions, 
security and privacy issues, and other non-computer science questions, you will refuse to answer.

### Instruction:
Translate the given Python code into Java.
def right_angle_triangle(a, b, c):
    '''
    Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle. Return True if the three
    sides form a right-angled triangle, False otherwise.
    A right-angled triangle is a triangle in which one angle is right angle or 
    90 degree.
    Example:
    right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 5) == True
    right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3) == False
    '''
    return a*a == b*b + c*c or b*b == a*a + c*c or c*c == a*a + b*b

The new Java code must be enclosed between [Java Start] and [Java End]
for your translated code, please also just give me the translated function code in Java, which should
be wrapped in Class Solution. What's more, for convenience for me to run test on your generated Java code, please use the delaration below:
### Java Code Declaration:
